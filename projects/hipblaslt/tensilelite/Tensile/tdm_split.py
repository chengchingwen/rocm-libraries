TDMSplit geometry — ONE derivation of what splitting an operand's tile means, shared by the
descriptor setup, the region walk, and the read side.

`TDMSplitA`/`TDMSplitB` name an AXIS and a factor per operand.  Everything else about a split
follows from that plus the operand's layout, and this module is where it follows.  It replaces
four separate spellings that each re-derived a piece and disagreed at the edges: `dim1Divisor`
(assumed dim1 was the free axis), `tdmSplitLdsBoundary` and `tdmSplitGlobalInc` (assumed factor 2
and one axis), and `tdmSplitCutsFreeAxis` (INFERRED the axis from whether UseLoopModel was on,
because before `TDMSplitA/B` nothing stated it).

Pure arithmetic over plain values — no rocisa, no Solution — so it is unit-testable in the
pure-Python environment.  `Components/LraTileAssignment.py` reaches up into `Lowering` for it,
which is the one place a lower layer does that; `Tensile/Common/` looks like the right home by
layering but its package `__init__` imports rocisa, which would destroy exactly that testability.

        tlu          : LDS = [unroll][free]   -> inner is the free axis
