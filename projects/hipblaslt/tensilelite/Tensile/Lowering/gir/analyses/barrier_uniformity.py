"""
BarrierUniformity -- every wave must reach every cross-wave fence.

A fence at block or cluster scope is a rendezvous: the waves that arrive wait for the waves that
have not. So it must sit where ALL of them run. A wave that skips it does not stall -- the ones
that did arrive do, forever.

The check walks each proc-scoped fence back to the entry block and reports any block on the way
that some waves can skip: one restricted to a subset by its `role`, or one entered through a
guard whose predicate reads a symbol that varies per wave.

This is a liveness property. The ledger only proves the ORDERING obligations were discharged, so
it is satisfied by a fence no wave reaches; only this says the fence is reachable.
`barrier_uniformity_asm.py` asks the same question of the emitted instruction stream.
