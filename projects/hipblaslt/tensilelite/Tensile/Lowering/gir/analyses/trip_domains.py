"""
TripDomains -- the trip counts each CFG edge admits.

Two arms created by different scaffold passes are correlated when they test the same trip symbol:
`prologue` guards the peel on `T == 1` and `prologue_join` enters the steady loop on `T > 2`, so a
path through the PGR1 arm cannot reach `steady` at all.  Keying on the SYMBOL rather than on the
predicate is what lets the two passes stay ignorant of each other -- the domains intersect, and an
empty intersection is the exclusion.

The domain is a bounded enumeration of trip counts, matching what StinkyTofu already reasons in,
so the frame contract ships the answer rather than the condition.
